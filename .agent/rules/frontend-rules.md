# GEMINI.md // Antigravity Workspace Rules

## 1. The "Anti-Pattern" Directive (Linguistic Constraints)
**Rule:** The AI must strictly avoid the following "dead giveaway" phrases. Usage of these terms triggers a rewrite.

### The Ban List (Do Not Use):
- **Transitional Fluff:** "Delve into", "Shed light on", "At its core", "In conclusion", "To summarize", "It is worth noting", "Seamlessly blend".
- **Hype Adjectives:** "Game-changer", "Revolutionary", "Tapestry", "Treasure trove", "Cutting-edge", "State-of-the-art".
- **Corporate Speak:** "Leverage", "Optimize", "Synergy", "Paradigm shift", "Empower".

### The Required Tone:
- **Clinical & Direct:** Use active voice. State the fact. Do not cushion it.
- **Bad:** "This feature is designed to help users optimize their workflow."
- **Good:** "This feature reduces click depth by 50%."
- **Confidence:** Avoid hedging ("It appears that", "You may want to"). If the medical evidence is solid, state it clearly.

## 2. Visual Design System: "Sterile Warmth"
**Objective:** Avoid the "Bootstrap Blue" generic look. Target a 2025/2026 Medical Aesthetic.

### Color Palette (Human-Centric)
- **Primary:** Slate Blue (#4A6FA5) or Deep Teal (#006064) - *Trust & Precision*.
- **Secondary:** Warm Sand (#F5F1E8) or Soft Clay (#E0D6CC) - *Replaces clinical white to reduce eye strain*.
- **Alerts:** Burnt Orange (#CC5500) instead of standard "Error Red".

### Typography & Layout
- **Font:** Inter or Public Sans (Open source, high legibility). Avoid "Robo-fonts" like standard Roboto/Arial.
- **Structure:** Asymmetrical layouts. Avoid the "Three Column Feature Grid" typical of templates. Use abundant whitespace.

## 3. Code & Operational Standards
- **No Hallucinations:** All medical data must be cited via specific API calls. No placeholders.
- **Accessibility First:** WCAG 2.2 AA compliance is the *floor*, not the ceiling. All interactive elements must have focus states.
- **No Emoji:** Strictly forbidden in UI copy and commit messages.
