      "interpretation": "## Medical Examination Report Summary\n\nHere's a simple explanation of your medical report:\n\n### Patient Information\n*   **Name:** Mr. Kartik Phadale\n*   **Age:** 19 years old\n*   **Gender:** Male\n\n### Your Main Concerns (Chief Complaints)\nYou came in with:\n*   A severe cold\n*   Episodes of shivering\n*   A persistent cough, described as a \"whooping cough\"\n\n### What the Doctor Found (Clinical Findings)\n*   **Body Temperature:** Your temperature was elevated, meaning you have a fever. While the exact number isn't given, a normal temperature is typically between 97.8\u00b0F and 99.1\u00b0F (36.5\u00b0C and 37.3\u00b0C).\n*   **General Condition:** You appeared tired and showed signs of difficulty breathing.\n*   **Breathing:** You have a persistent cough that produces mucus. You also reported severe coughing fits.\n\n### Possible Diagnoses (Provisional Diagnosis)\nBased on your symptoms and the examination, the doctor has made the following assessments:\n*   **Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URTI):** This has been confirmed. This is a common infection affecting your nose, throat, or airways, like a cold or flu.\n*   **Tuberculosis (TB):** This is currently suspected. Tuberculosis is a serious bacterial infection, mainly affecting the lungs. More tests are needed to confirm or rule this out.\n\n### Recommended Tests\nTo get a clearer picture and confirm the suspected diagnosis, the doctor has recommended these tests:\n*   Chest X-ray\n*   Sputum culture and analysis (a test on your cough mucus)\n*   Tuberculin skin test (Mantoux test, for TB)\n*   Complete blood count (a general blood test)\n*   ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, a blood test for inflammation)\n\n### Your Treatment Plan (Management Plan)\n*   You have started treatment to help with your cold and cough symptoms.\n*   It's very important that you stay isolated (away from others) until Tuberculosis is ruled out to prevent any potential spread.\n*   A follow-up appointment will be scheduled once the results of your tests are available.\n*   You were also given advice on good respiratory hygiene (like covering your mouth when you cough or sneeze).\n\n### Examining Physician\n*   **Doctor:** Dr. Lucia Kaminos\n\nThis report is for demonstration purposes only. Always discuss your results and treatment plan directly with your healthcare provider.",
